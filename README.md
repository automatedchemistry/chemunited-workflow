A NetworkX-based workflow execution engine for conditional automation of chemistry experiments. Designed for hardware-in-the-loop laboratory protocols where operations depend on device responses, physical measurements, and branching conditions.

## Features

- **Conditional DAG execution** with loopbacks and parallel branches
- **Device-centric HTTP clients** for hardware control (pipettes, reactors, pumps, etc.)
- **Thread-safe parallel node execution** via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **Physical unit handling** (volumes, temperatures, concentrations) using Pint
- **Multiple deployment modes**: FastAPI REST API, MCP server, or direct Python execution
- **Protocol versioning** with timestamped file history and schema validation
- **Single-run execution model** — only one experiment at a time; `POST /run/` returns HTTP 409 if a run is already active, preventing accidental double-dispatch on physical hardware
- **Browser-based dashboard** (Vue SPA) with live run monitoring, per-node progress bars, log viewer, and device status — its built assets ship with the package, no build step required to use it
- **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints** — a node can pause and wait for an operator to reply on the dashboard before continuing, with a mandatory timeout so a run never blocks forever
- **Customisable per-project dashboard** — drop a pre-built SPA into `{project}/customizations/ui/dist/` to override the bundled UI; falls back automatically when absent
- **Standalone sensor monitoring** — register device variables, start polling sessions independent of protocol runs, and read back time-series profiles
